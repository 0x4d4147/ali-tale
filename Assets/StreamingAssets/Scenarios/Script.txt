	+ I see.  I understand you not feeling comfortable saying anything to me right now.
	+ I do hope you will think about it and if anything comes to mind, that you let me know so I can help James.
	+ And please, if you see James later today, please tell him to talk to myself or any other teacher.  We all would want to help.
	+ Well, Ali, we really must get going or we'll be late!  Will you walk with me to school?


	"Ali" says
	+ Of course, Mr. Smith.  I'll be right behind you.

	"Sage" says
	+ I'm glad you were able to tell Mr. Smith a little bit about what is going on with James.
	+ However, I think you could have told him more about what you know.
	+ Being an ally doesn't mean you have to do everything yourself, even though it usually feels like you do.
	+ Telling a trusted adult about a difficult situation is another powerful way to be an ally, and what James needed in this moment.  I hope we have the opportunity in the future to further help James.
	+ Now then, we need to get you to school before you're late!
